That's an excellent question, as the two terms are often used interchangeably or their responsibilities overlap in microservices architecture.

The core difference lies in their scope: **Auth Services (or Identity Services) handle *who you are*** (authentication and authorization), while **User Services handle *what you are*** (your profile data and state).

Here is a breakdown of their responsibilities:

***

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication (Auth/Identity Services)

The **Authentication (Auth) Service**, often called **Identity Service**, is narrowly focused on proving and managing a user's identity.

| Responsibility | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Verifying the user's identity, typically through a username/password. |
| **Authorization** | Determining **what** the authenticated user is allowed to do (checking roles/permissions). |
| **Token Management** | Generating, validating, and revoking secure tokens (like JWTs) for access to other services. |
| **Credential Management** | Handling password hashing, password reset requests, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). |
| **Session Management** | Tracking active user sessions. |

**Goal:** To securely issue an access token that proves the user is legitimate and carries their permissions.

***

## ðŸ‘¤ User Services

The **User Service** (or Profile Service) is responsible for managing all the **non-security-critical data** related to a user.

| Responsibility | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Profile Management** | Storing and retrieving user profile data (name, email, phone number, college ID, etc.). |
| **Role/Metadata** | Storing the user's assigned role (e.g., "Financial Officer," "System Admin") and other service-specific metadata. |
| **Data Aggregation** | Serving as the canonical source for all other services to look up user-specific details. |
| **State Management** | Managing the user's status (e.g., active, suspended, verified). |

**Goal:** To manage and expose the user's identity attributes (data) to other services.

## The Collaboration and Distinction in Your Platform

In your RUB Bhutan colleges platform, this separation is crucial for security and scalability:

1.  **Sign-In Flow (Collaboration):**
    * The user sends credentials to the **Auth Service**.
    * The **Auth Service** verifies the credentials.
    * The **Auth Service** might then query the **User Service** to fetch the user's **Role** (`Financial Officer`).
    * The **Auth Service** creates a secure **JWT** that contains the user's ID and Role, and returns it to the API Gateway.

2.  **Accessing Student Data (Authorization):**
    * A service (like `Financial Services`) receives a request and uses the **JWT**.
    * The service first verifies the JWT signature (often done by the API Gateway or the service itself using the **Auth Service's** public key).
    * It checks the role inside the token (e.g., is the user a "Financial Officer"?). This check relies purely on the security information provided by the **Auth Service**.

3.  **Viewing Profile (User Service Only):**
    * The user wants to view their name, college, and phone number. The API Gateway routes the request directly to the **User Service**.
    * The **User Service** fetches and returns the profile data. The Auth Service is not involved in this operation other than token validation.

**In summary:**

| Service | Answers the question... | Handles the entity... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Auth/Identity Services** | **"Can this person access this resource?"** | Credentials, Tokens, Permissions |
| **User Services** | **"What information do we know about this person?"** | Name, Contact, College, Role (as an attribute) |
